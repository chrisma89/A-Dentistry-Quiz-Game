# Chrisma-Code-Quiz

## About the Project

This project was developed and deployed to create a quiz which the user can complete to see their scores and compare it with the highscores present.The html files were downloaded from the bootcampspot and javascript codes have been written, deployed and tested. 

The quiz has a landing page with a start button, which has been used to add eventlistener to start the quiz. The landing page contents have been made to disappear, followed by the start of the timer and the first question appears with the choices.

On click of a choice button, feedback is delivered onto the page to enhance user experience ad the next question appears. If the answer is wrong, the timer is deducted by 10 seconds as explained on the landing page. If all the questions are answered, or if the timer runs out, the scores page appears with the user's scores displayed and an option to submit their initials. If the user submits the form with their initials, the highscores page apears with the user's scores and all available previous highscores.
